# Book Organiser

A program to organise my digital library of books. Please note that this is a
personal project and has been designed for myself. Others are free to clone/fork
this project, build and run it locally, and use it as they want but please keep
in mind that if things aren't clear or don't work on your machine that is because
this project wasn't made with others in mind.
